# Concrete_crack_detection

The goal of this project is to build a AI product to be used by construction engineers as a tool to process and analyze the existance of cracks in building's frontage as part of the recurrent mandatory safety check required by the firefighters in Brazil.

As a success metric os this PoC, the model/solution must:
- be easy to use;
- have low latency;
- have high recall

As a prof of concept, this product must be took to a new level after successed, the plan for the next phase include:
- New data gathering of real building to mimic the real application environment;
- Data labelling by a domain specialist;
- Retrain the models;
- Build a interface as a product.
